# GapTutor

GapTutor is an AI-powered chatbot designed to identify knowledge gaps in students' understanding and provide personalized learning strategies to address them.

## Idea
Most AI tutors only answer questions when prompted. GapTutor goes further:
1. Diagnoses weak areas through dialogue or quick tests.  
2. Builds a personalized study plan with priorities.  
3. Adapts explanations and exercises to the student's level.

## Why it matters
Students often struggle to see what they do not know.  
GapTutor makes these "blind spots" visible and helps focus learning efforts where they are most needed.  
The result is more efficient and effective studying.

## Features (planned)
- Knowledge gap diagnostics in a chosen subject.  
- Generation of a personalized learning plan.  
- Multi-level explanations depending on prior knowledge.  
- Practice tasks and progress tracking.

## Next steps
- Select the initial subject domain (e.g., mathematics, computer science).  
- Implement a basic chatbot prototype.  
- Add adaptive learning capabilities over time.
